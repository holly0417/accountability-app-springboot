# Accountability App

Accountability App is a web-based application designed to help you complete day-to-day tasks using a rewards-based accountability system. 
The purpose of this app is to bring a form of instant gratification to our mundane, every-day tasks but in a way that feels more meaningful via actual accountability from other people. 
Users can request partnerships with other users, keep track of payments, and earn "money" through having their completed tasks approved by their partners. 
You can compare your earnings with that of your partners and "spend" those earnings through registering payments into your wallet. 

Disclaimer: This app is still very much in development! It's my personal sandbox project for learning how to develop apps. 
So if you'd like to pull this image, know that it may not run as smoothly as you may expect.

# For Docker containerization configuration
### In your `docker-compose.yml`
Pull image from this url: `ghcr.io/holly394/accountability:master`
Make sure you have these following files available in your container:
	`/workspace/logs`
	`/workspace/database`
	`/workspace/application.yml`
Set the container port to port `8080`
See example here:
```
services:  
  accountability-app:  
    container_name: accountability-app  
    image: ghcr.io/holly394/accountability:master  
    ports:  
      - "8080:8080"

# Database and log file configuration
### In your `application.yml`
You can set the database URL, username, password, as well as the log level for messages from this application.
You can also set a Gmail SMTP server here so that you can send emails with password reset links if needed. 

Here, it's set to an H2 database, but you can connect yours to PostgreSQL or any other relational database service. 

You can also set the log level for your project related messages as well as the file path.

# How to use (for users)
When first registering, each user starts out with a value of 0 in their wallet. 
You can start earning money and increase the value in your wallet by completing tasks and having your partners approve them.

# Registration & resetting password
Users can sign in, reset their passwords if they forget them by having a reset token link sent to their email, and see their account information.<br>

# Main Functionality: Tasks
- Once you submit a new task, it will show up in your To-do list.
- From there, you can choose to either start or delete the task.
- Once started, the task will go into the "Tasks in progress" section where it will be time-tracked.
- The amount of time taken on each task is grouped by status and a total is calculated for how much the user could potentially "earn".
- However, earnings are added to the wallet only after a task has been completed and approved by a partner.
- Users can see a list of their approved & rejected tasks, how much they've earned in their personal wallet, as well as recent tasks from their partners.

# Find partners
- Users can find other existing users in the platform and request a partnership.
- Once a partnership is requested, users can either approve, reject, or delete the request based on whether they sent or received the request. 
- Only requesters can delete a pending request while only senders of a rejection can undo a rejected partnership.

# Wallet & purchases
- Users can also make "purchases" using the earnings available in their wallets.

# Graphs & visuals
- Users can see a visual graph showing the top 5 approved tasks by time duration among them and their partners.
- They can also see a visual graph of wallet amounts among them and their partners.
